# 🎉 Project Introduction
Babyboom is a baby growth memory platform designed to help mothers document every precious moment of their child's development. The platform offers a user-friendly interface that allows moms to create and browse their baby's growth records with ease. In addition, users can enjoy the unique "BOOM" feature — a personalized memory blind box powered by AI, bringing back heartwarming moments in a surprising and delightful way.

# 🚀 Tech Stack
Java + Spring Boot + MyBatis-Plus + MySQL + RabbitMQ

The platform integrates the Qwen visual-language model to analyze uploaded images. The resulting textual analysis is then stored in the database for future reference.
